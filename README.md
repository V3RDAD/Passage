It is an router addon for private domain and anonymous oriented networks.

In this new version you will be able to host on domains that are not limited to just .i2p or b32.i2p.

So far, you won't be able to host, connect to normal .i2p domains, but these two below.

```
>NETWORK_TREE
|_s
|_slink
```

(you may of course alter them into whatever you'd like as I left out the source code for you)

Download https://gitlab.com/i2pplus/I2P.Plus/, insert it there and build it with https://ant.apache.org/
## How to do it

Simply drag the /lib/i2ptunnel.jar into I2P+ version 1.9.0
