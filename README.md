It is an router addon for private domain and anonymous oriented networks.

In this new version you will be able to host on domains that are not limited to just .i2p or b32.i2p.

As of now you won't be able to access normal .i2p domains.

## How to do it

Simply drag the /lib/i2ptunnel.jar into I2P+ version 1.9.0
