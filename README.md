This is an addon for the i2p+ router.

In this new version you will be able to host on domains that are not limited to just .i2p or b32.i2p.

You are now able to connect to normal .i2p domains, and these below.

```
>NETWORK_TREE
|_s
|_slink
|_sweb
|_shweb
|_free
```

(you may of course alter them into whatever you'd like as I left out the source code for you)

Download https://gitlab.com/i2pplus/I2P.Plus/, insert it there and build it with https://ant.apache.org/
## How to do it

Simply drag the /lib/i2ptunnel.jar,/docs/ files into I2P+ version 1.9.0  https://web.archive.org/web/20221105001551/https://i2pplus.github.io/

You can finally die now knowing that OP is no longer a fag.


Is it 6 years now since cnode4.0 and DFN 2.0 got released? :P
