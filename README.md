This is an addon for the i2p+ router,
You can host on domains that are not limited to; .i2p or b32.i2p.

## New Domains
```
These domains will be recognized as the internal I2P network and therefore,
you can add them to your addressbook and assign them Base-64, Base-32 links.
However they are nothing but fancy cosmetics to add to your website as a mirror.

\fully supported
|_i2p
|_i2cb
\only http proxy supported
|_s
|_sh
|_sl(not included)
|_slink
|_sweb
|_shweb
|_murd

|_free

```

(you may of course alter them into whatever you'd like as I left out the source code for you)

Download https://gitlab.com/i2pplus/I2P.Plus/, insert it there and build it with https://ant.apache.org/

"The So-Called Pass is a browser extension for the Tor browser. Here you can draw such an analogy - from a regular browser you can get to the regular Internet, and there you can find Tor, and from Tor you can get into the darknet ... To find it there ... No, not a browser .. But the pass is the next important point.
It operates on the principle of garlic routing. And it is a mechanism for accessing an even more secure and anonymous network." - russian deepweb iceberg.

I will attach a map of the passes here.

While I do not agree with many iceberg images, this modification does count as a "passage", to places below.

Contact network owners for ?i2paddresshelper destination,
