This is an addon for the i2p+ router,
You can host on domains that are not limited to; .i2p or b32.i2p.

I drew inspiration from the russian iceberg image;
```
LEVEL B:

"The So-Called Pass is an extension for the browser called the [....] . Here you can draw such an analogy - from a regular browser you can get to the regular Internet, and

there you can find Tor, and from Tor you can get into the darknet [....] To find it there [....] No, not a browser [....] But the pass is the next important point.

It operates on the principle of garlic routing."
```
And so I've created my own "Pass"

## New Domains
```
These domains will be recognized as the internal I2P network.
However they are nothing but fancy cosmetics to add to your website mirror.
