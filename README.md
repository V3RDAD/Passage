# I2P PLUS PLUS
It is an router addon for private domain and anonymous oriented networks.
In this new version you will bre able to host on domains that are not limited to just .i2p or b32.i2p.

Right now most of it is in work in progress, however if you want an early peak,
Dm me if you want it, or if you want to join already created networks.
