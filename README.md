Passage is a modification for the I2P+ router, it will allow you to host on domains that are not limited to; .i2p or b32.i2p.

"The So-Called Pass is a browser extension for the Tor browser. Here you can draw such an analogy - from a regular browser you can get to the regular Internet, and there you can find Tor, and from Tor you can get into the darknet ... To find it there ... No, not a browser .. But the pass is the next important point."
- Russian Deep web folklore.

## New Domains
```
These domains will be recognized as the internal I2P network and therefore,
you can add them to your addressbook and assign them Base-64, Base-32 links.
However they are nothing but fancy cosmetics to add to your website as a mirror.
