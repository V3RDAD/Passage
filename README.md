This is an addon for the i2p+ router.
## {WIP}
```
New Domains
You can host on domains that are not limited to; .i2p or b32.i2p.
You are now able to host and connect to added domains:

>I2P++
\fully supported
|_i2p
|_i2cb
\only http proxy supported
|_free
|_s
|_slink
|_sweb
|_shweb

```

(you may of course alter them into whatever you'd like as I left out the source code for you)

Download https://gitlab.com/i2pplus/I2P.Plus/, insert it there and build it with https://ant.apache.org/
## How to do it

Simply drag the /lib/i2ptunnel.jar,/docs/ files into I2P+ version 1.9.0  https://web.archive.org/web/20221105001551/https://i2pplus.github.io/





You can finally die now knowing that OP is no longer a fag.
