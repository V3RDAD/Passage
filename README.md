This is an addon for the i2p+ router,
You can host on domains that are not limited to; .i2p or b32.i2p.

## New Domains
```
These domains will be recognized as the internal I2P network and therefore,
you can add them to your addressbook and assign them Base-64, Base-32 links.
However they are nothing but fancy cosmetics to add to your website as a mirror.
