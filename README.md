This is an addon for the i2p+ router,
You can host on domains that are not limited to; .i2p or b32.i2p.

## New Domains
```
These domains will be recognized as the internal I2P network and therefore,
you can add them to your addressbook and assign them Base-64, Base-32 links.
However they are nothing but fancy cosmetics to add to your website as a mirror.

\fully supported

|_i2cb
\only http proxy supported

(you may of course alter them into whatever you'd like as I left out the source code for you)

## How to do it
Simply drag the /lib/i2ptunnel.jar into I2P+ installation folder.
